# steganography
lab 1:
  hide message in spaces between container text. if in binary form we have "1" then there will be a double space. if "0" - then a single space.

lab 2:
  hide message by changing ukrainian letters on english. we have a container with ukrainian text. a message, that we want to hide will be on english language. so we   have two sets of Ukrainian letters that are also found in English. Encoding algorithm: if in our text we meet this letter => we change it to english letter.
 
lab 3:
  hide message to picture(*png) by LSB(least significant bit) method.
